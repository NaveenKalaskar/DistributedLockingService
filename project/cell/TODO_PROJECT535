modifications need to be made : 

customization for chubby
====================================================


> only one replica receives request.

 >> go for the simpler one..!! 

state to have multiple locks.. 

so state is an array of locks??

wheres is the file abstraction??


how is lock request rejected..
============================================

ballot number as the leader number ..

replicas ping the leaders .. 

if replica responds within a time frame.. no replica spawns a leader..

else after n secs of ping with no response, the first replica spawns a scout.

the second replica spawns a scout if after 2n secs, no new leader info is provided.

=============================================

Improvement 1 :

> p1b messages will include only the maximum pvalue seen so far.  

( 
this one reduces the p1b  message size, as well as the acceptor's

state size ) (at most a constant or linear increasing state ) 

	
> p1a message modification, only those slots that are required.

reduces the p1b message size.

=============================================

Improvement 2 : 

If all replicas have learnt a decision for a slot, the acceptors need not maintain those pvalues..

replicas communicate to leaders.. leaders -> acceptors.

( gc_slotnumber : is returned in the p1b ) 

==============================================

Improvement 3 : Error

Pinging the leader by replicas  every n secs...

ping wait..


The Replica assigned as leader, spawns a leader process. Every Replica spawns a heartbeat thread which is made aware the leader of among them. 

If an old leader wakes up and comes alive, it tries to use an old ballot number, which will not be accepted by any acceptor and thus will be pre-empted and it learns from acceptors the new identity of the leader, and intimates the Replica which spawns an heartbeat process, and participates in 
decision making..


HeartBeat process in each replica should ping the leader replica every configured sec. 

	It should be aware of the id which is currently the leader and also its identity. 
	It should also be aware of the replica identity which spawned it.
	


	


if the response if not obtained after n attempts, it should intimate the replica, if its replicas turn, it will turn off hb, and spawn a leader.
and intimate other replicas about its identity. If after 2n attempts itdoesn't respond, then its
